# 2. Refined UI Controls in Testbed

**Summary:** Improve the existing testbed (`index.html`, `js/visualizer-main.js`) for more comprehensive interaction and testing of kernel features.

**Details (from Refactoring Summary V.2):**
*   Add more UI elements to interactively test the full range of new parameters exposed during the refactoring.
*   Include more complex `dataSnapshot` examples and `setDataMappingRules` scenarios to simulate PMK input effectively.

**Core Principles Alignment:**
*   **Testability:** Directly supports making the current system more robust and verifiable.
*   **Documentation:** Serves as a live example of how to use the `VisualizerController` API.
