# 8. Comprehensive Documentation

**Summary:** Create detailed documentation for developers and users of the visualization kernel.

**Details (from Refactoring Summary V.8):**
*   Create detailed API documentation for `VisualizerController`, including all controllable parameters, `dataSnapshot` structure expectations, and the full list of controllable parameters with their effects.
*   Provide tutorials or examples for integrating the kernel with external data sources.
*   Document the architecture, parameter mapping system, and how to create new geometries or plugins.

**Core Principles Alignment:**
*   **Maintainability & Extensibility:** Good documentation is key for a lean and adaptable system.
*   **Usability:** Makes the system accessible to other developers or agent integrators.
