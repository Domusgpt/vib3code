# 1. Advanced Parameter Mapping Logic

**Summary:** Enhance the Parameter Mapping Layer within `VisualizerController.js`.

**Details (from Refactoring Summary V.1):**
*   Implement diverse `transform` functions (e.g., linear/logarithmic scaling, clamping, thresholding, string-to-enum-to-float, color mapping).
*   Allow mapping rules to be conditional based on other `dataSnapshot` values.
*   Introduce a more formal schema for `dataChannelDefinition` and `setDataMappingRules` payloads.

**Core Principles Alignment:**
*   **Lean Kernel:** Enhancements should primarily be within the `VisualizerController` or its mapping logic, keeping `HypercubeCore.js` focused on rendering and state.
*   **Adaptability:** Increases the kernel's adaptability to diverse data inputs from agents like PMK.
*   **Performance:** Transformation logic should be efficient to avoid bottlenecks in the data pipeline.
