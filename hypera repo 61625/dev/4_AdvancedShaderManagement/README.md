# 4. Advanced Shader Management

**Summary:** Enhance the flexibility and dynamism of shader usage.

**Details (from Refactoring Summary V.4 & `ADVANCED_SHADER_CONCEPTS.md`):**
*   **Dynamic Shader Snippet Injection:** Allow `VisualizerController` to request `ShaderManager` to compile shaders with or without specific GLSL code snippets for highly dynamic visual changes.
*   **Uber-Shaders:** Develop more complex "uber-shaders" with many boolean toggles and factors controlled by UBO channels or uniforms, reducing the need for shader recompilation for common variations.

**Core Principles Alignment:**
*   **Lean Kernel:** Uber-shaders can reduce recompilation overhead. Snippet injection needs careful management to avoid excessive shader permutations.
*   **Performance:** Aims to balance flexibility with rendering performance.
*   **Adaptability:** Greatly increases the dynamic responsiveness of visuals to data.
