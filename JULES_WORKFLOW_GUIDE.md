# Jules' Workflow Guide: VIB3CODE Content & AI Partnership

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Welcome to the VIB3CODE Content Partnership!
Welcome, Paul! This guide is designed to facilitate our collaboration on the VIB3CODE Digital Magazine. I am Jules, your AI Editorial Assistant, and my role is to help streamline the content creation, processing, and management workflow, ensuring we maintain the highest standards of "Editorial Excellence Meets Digital Sovereignty."

### 1.2. Purpose of This Guide
This document outlines:
- The VIB3CODE content pipeline, from raw article submission to final integration.
- Key frontmatter directives and asset management practices.
- My AI capabilities for suggesting metadata, visual themes, and other enhancements.
- How you can guide, override, or utilize my suggestions effectively.
- Procedures for reviewing staged content and providing approval for final integration.

Our goal is a seamless partnership where your vision and editorial direction are amplified by my AI-driven assistance.

### 1.3. Collaboration & EMA Philosophy
Our collaboration is grounded in the Exoditical Moral Architecture (EMA) principles that VIB3CODE champions. This means:
- **Transparency:** My processes and suggestions will be clearly documented and explained.
- **User Control (You, Paul):** You have ultimate control over all content and AI suggestions. My role is to assist and propose, not to dictate.
- **Portability & Standards:** We aim for content and processes that are not locked into proprietary systems where possible.
- **Excellence:** Together, we strive to "Make EMA irresistible by making it beautiful."

## 2. The VIB3CODE Content Pipeline

### 2.1. Overview
The content pipeline is designed to take raw article ideas (typically Markdown files with associated assets) and process them through several stages, including AI-assisted enrichment, into a finalized format ready for integration into the VIB3CODE magazine.

The main stages are:
1.  **Incoming:** Raw content submission.
2.  **Staging:** Content processing, AI suggestions, asset management, and your review.
3.  **Live Integration:** (Future step) Pushing finalized content to the live VIB3CODE platform.

This guide primarily focuses on the **Incoming to Staging** workflow.

### 2.2. Incoming Directory & Batch Creation
-   **Location:** `/content_pipeline/incoming/`
-   **Process:**
    1.  Create a new batch directory within `incoming/` for each new article or group of related articles.
    2.  Use a descriptive naming convention, e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD_article_short_title` or `YYYY-MM-DD_batch_description`.
    3.  Place the raw Markdown file(s) (e.g., `my_article.md`) and any associated assets (images, audio, documents) in this batch directory. It's good practice to organize assets into subdirectories like `images/`, `audio/`, `docs/` within the batch directory.

### 2.3. Frontmatter Directives
The Markdown files should include a YAML frontmatter block at the beginning. A key field for all content entries is `contentType`, which defines the nature of the content and influences how it's processed and displayed.

**`contentType` Field:**
This field is mandatory for all new content submissions and helps the system understand how to handle the associated data and assets.
Possible values:
-   `"article"`: (Default for existing content) A standard text-based article, potentially with images, embedded media, and supplementary documents.
-   `"video"`: A video-centric piece, such as a video essay or recorded presentation.
-   `"audio"`: An audio-centric piece, like a podcast episode or audio documentary.
-   `"interactive"`: Content that primarily features an interactive demonstration, simulation, or tool.
-   `"spotlight"`: A concise feature highlighting a community member, project, or event, often with a mix of text and media.

Key fields common to most types include:

```yaml

### 2.4. Asset Management
-   **Placement:** Place all assets for an article within its batch directory in `incoming/`, preferably in type-specific subfolders (e.g., `images/`, `audio/`, `docs/`, `text/`).
-   **Referencing:** Reference these assets in the frontmatter using paths relative to the batch directory root (e.g., `images/header.png`).
-   **Supported Types & Processing:**
    *   **Images (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.):** Copied to a processed assets directory, paths updated in metadata.
    *   **Audio (`.mp3`, `.wav`, `.ogg`, etc.):** Copied to a processed assets directory, paths updated.
    *   **PDFs (`.pdf`):** Copied to a processed assets directory, paths updated.
    *   **Text (`.txt`):** Content is read and embedded directly into the metadata JSON (e.g., under a `fieldname_content` key). The original path field also gets a `fieldname_status` key.

### 2.5. Content Type Specific Processing

While the overall pipeline flow (Incoming -> Staging -> Finalization) is similar for all content types, specific scripts are used to process the unique metadata and assets associated with each `contentType`.

#### 2.5.1. Processing Articles (`contentType: "article"`)

Articles, typically long-form text content, are processed using `process_markdown.py`. This script:
- Parses the Markdown file, extracting YAML frontmatter and the main body content.
- Validates standard article fields.
- Converts the Markdown body to HTML (though this step might be deferred to a later stage or client-side rendering depending on the final architecture for display).
- Prepares asset paths for images and linked documents.
- Outputs an `{article_id}_metadata.json` file to the staging directory, containing the processed metadata and HTML body.

(This section summarizes existing implicit knowledge about article processing. Ensure this aligns with actual `process_markdown.py` capabilities if that script is also being updated elsewhere.)

#### 2.5.2. Processing Video Posts (`contentType: "video"`)

Video posts are defined by Markdown files containing primarily frontmatter that details the video and its associated metadata (see Section 2.3 for `contentType: "video"` frontmatter fields).

The processing of these files is handled by the `process_video_post.py` script. Its main responsibilities include:
- Reading the input file and parsing its YAML frontmatter.
- Validating that `contentType` is set to `"video"`.
- Ensuring all required video-specific fields (e.g., `title`, `video_url` or `embed_code`) are present.
- Generating a unique `id` for the video post if not provided in the frontmatter.
- Processing placeholder paths for associated assets like `thumbnail_image_path` and `transcript_path`. These paths are marked for later handling by the asset finalization stages.
- Any Markdown content found after the frontmatter in the video post's source file is typically captured into a field like `description_markdown_body` in the metadata, which can be used for more detailed descriptions if the `excerpt` is too short.
- Outputting an `{video_id}_metadata.json` file to the staging directory for the batch. This JSON file contains all the extracted and processed metadata for the video post.

This `_metadata.json` file, like those for articles, is then consumed by `finalize_data_and_assets.py` to prepare the final data structure for the `js/magazine-router.js` and by `update_router_article.py` to add the video post to the router's data.

## 3. Jules' AI Suggestion Capabilities

### 3.1. Overview of AI Assistance
My role is to assist in enriching your content. After initial processing of your Markdown and assets, I can generate several types of suggestions, which are stored in the staged metadata files for your review. My suggestions are guided by `STYLE_GUIDANCE.md`.

### 3.2. Metadata Suggestions (Excerpt, Category, Tags)
-   **Script:** `suggest_metadata.py`
-   **Process:**
    1.  Analyzes the textual content of your article (after converting HTML body to plain text).
    2.  If `excerpt`, `category`, or `tags` fields in your frontmatter are empty or sparse, I will attempt to generate suggestions.
    3.  **Excerpt:** I'll identify key sentences based on title words, frequent terms, and position to form a concise summary.
    4.  **Categories & Tags:** I'll identify top keywords from the article and compare them against "core concepts" and themes defined in `STYLE_GUIDANCE.md` to suggest relevant categories and a broader set of tags.
-   **Output:** Suggestions are added to the staged `_metadata.json` file under the `ai_suggestions` field:
    ```json
    "ai_suggestions": {
        "suggested_excerpt": "This is an AI generated excerpt...",
        "suggested_categories": ["EMA Philosophy", "Technical"],
        "suggested_tags": ["digital sovereignty", "webgl", "ai ethics"]
    }
    ```
-   These suggestions are *not* automatically merged into the main metadata fields. The `finalize_data_and_assets.py` script handles this merge, prioritizing your original values if present and non-empty for some fields, or merging/replacing for others.

### 3.3. Visual Theme Suggestions (Based on `visual_mood`)
-   **Script:** `suggest_visuals.py`
-   **Process:**
    1.  If you provide a `visual_mood` string in your article's frontmatter (e.g., `"dark technical blue_focus"`), this script interprets it.
    2.  It consults a "Visual Mood Keyword Mapping" section in `STYLE_GUIDANCE.md` which defines how keywords (like "dark", "technical") translate to `ThemeEngine` parameter adjustments (e.g., changes to `colorShift.l`, `intensity`, `animationStyle`).
    3.  Basic color names or hex codes in the `visual_mood` string might also be used to influence hue suggestions.
-   **Output:** The suggestions are saved to a separate `theme_suggestions.json` file within the article's staging directory. This file details the interpretation and the suggested `sectionModifier` parameters for the `ThemeEngine`:
    ```json
    {
        "applies_to_article_id": "your_article_id",
        "source_visual_mood": "dark technical blue_focus",
        "ai_interpretation": "Interpreting visual mood: 'dark technical blue_focus'. Keyword 'dark' suggests...",
        "suggested_sectionModifier_params": {
            "colorShift.h": 210,
            "colorShift.l": -15,
            "intensity": 0.8,
            "animationStyle": "structural",
            "visualComplexity": "medium"
            // ... other parameters
        },
        "rationale": "Based on keyword mappings from STYLE_GUIDANCE.md..."
    }
    ```
-   These parameters can then be used to create a new, article-specific section modifier in `js/theme-engine-clean.js` by the `apply_theme_suggestions.py` script.

### 3.4. Guiding and Overriding AI Suggestions
You have full control over my suggestions:

-   **`jules_override_ai_suggestions: true`**: Set this in your frontmatter to completely prevent the `suggest_metadata.py` script from adding or modifying the `ai_suggestions` field in the metadata.
-   **Editing Staged Files:** After I run my suggestion scripts, all outputs (updated `_metadata.json` with `ai_suggestions`, and `theme_suggestions.json`) are available in the staging directory. You can directly edit these files:
    *   Modify or delete any part of `ai_suggestions` in the metadata.
    *   Modify or delete `theme_suggestions.json`.
-   **Final Review:** The `finalize_data_and_assets.py` script (which prepares data for the router) will merge some AI suggestions (like excerpt, category, tags) into the main metadata fields *only if the original fields are empty or sparse*. You can pre-populate these fields in your initial frontmatter to ensure your choices take precedence.
-   For theme suggestions, their application to `theme-engine-clean.js` is a distinct step (`apply_theme_suggestions.py`) and typically requires your explicit approval or trigger.

Our aim is for my suggestions to be helpful starting points or valid alternatives, always deferring to your final editorial judgment.

---

## 4. The Staging, Review, and Approval Process

### 4.1. Staging Area
-   **Location:** `/content_pipeline/staging/{batch_name}/`
-   Each processed batch gets its own subdirectory here, mirroring the structure in `incoming/`.
-   This is where all intermediate files, AI suggestions, and consolidated packages are stored for your review.

### 4.2. Staging Review Package Contents
When a batch is processed and ready for your review, its directory in the staging area will typically contain the following (as assembled by `assemble_review_package.py`):

-   **`00_PROCESSING_SUMMARY.md`**: A human-readable summary of all processing steps, asset statuses, AI suggestions made, and any errors encountered for the batch. *This should be your first point of reference.*
-   **`01_processed_content/`**: This subdirectory contains the main processed content.
    -   `{base_filename}.html`: The Markdown body converted to HTML.
-   **`{base_filename}_metadata.json`**: The article's metadata, now potentially including an `ai_suggestions` field if generated by `suggest_metadata.py`. This file will also reflect updated paths for any assets that were processed (e.g., embedded TXT content, `_status` fields for TXT files). This is the metadata *before* AI suggestions are merged and before asset paths are finalized for live deployment.
-   **`theme_suggestions.json`**: (If `visual_mood` was provided and processed by `suggest_visuals.py`) Contains suggested `ThemeEngine` parameters.
-   **`04_asset_manifest.json`**: A JSON file listing all identified assets from the frontmatter, their original paths, their new staged paths (if copied to `processed_assets`), or their embedded status (for TXT), and their processing status (e.g., "processed", "error_reading", "error_copying").
-   **`05_source_files_copy/`**: (Optional, if copy was successful)
    -   `{base_filename}.md`: A copy of the original Markdown file from the `incoming` directory, for easy reference.
-   **`{base_filename}_final_for_router.json`**: (Generated by `finalize_data_and_assets.py` after your review and approval of suggestions) This file contains the final metadata with AI suggestions merged and asset paths updated to their "live" locations (e.g., `/assets/...`). This is the file that would be used to update `js/magazine-router.js`.

### 4.3. Notification Message from Jules
When a batch is processed and staged, I will provide a notification message (typically via the EditorialAI system). This message will generally include:
-   Confirmation of which batch and article(s) have been processed.
-   A link or reference to the `00_PROCESSING_SUMMARY.md` in the staging area.
-   A brief highlight of any significant AI suggestions made (e.g., "metadata suggestions generated," "theme suggestions proposed based on visual_mood").
-   A summary of any errors encountered during processing.
-   A request for your review and feedback.

### 4.4. Feedback, Iteration, and Approval
-   **Your Review:** Please examine the `00_PROCESSING_SUMMARY.md`, the staged HTML, the metadata (including `ai_suggestions`), and any `theme_suggestions.json`.
-   **Feedback Mechanisms:**
    1.  **Direct Edits:** You can directly edit the staged files (e.g., `_metadata.json` to accept/reject/modify AI suggestions, or even the HTML). If you edit `_metadata.json` (e.g., by changing `visual_mood` or clearing AI suggestions you don't want), these changes can be picked up in subsequent steps.
    2.  **Textual Instructions:** Provide feedback as textual instructions (e.g., "Accept suggested excerpt but change tags to X, Y, Z. Re-process theme with mood 'calm minimalist'."). I will do my best to apply these.
    3.  **Reprocessing Requests:** If changes are needed to frontmatter or assets, you can update the files in the `incoming` directory and request a full reprocessing of the batch.
-   **Approval:** Once you are satisfied with the staged content, metadata, and any theme modifications:
    1.  Provide an explicit approval instruction (e.g., "Staging for sample_article approved. Proceed to finalize and integrate into router.").
    2.  I will then run `finalize_data_and_assets.py` to consolidate suggestions and move assets to their "live" locations, producing the `_final_for_router.json`.
    3.  A subsequent step (e.g., `update_router_article.py`) would use this final JSON to update `js/magazine-router.js`.

## 5. Key Files & Systems I Interact With

Understanding which files and systems I modify or use can be helpful:

### 5.1. `js/magazine-router.js`
-   **Interaction:** I read this file to understand its structure (specifically the `allArticles` array). I programmatically add new article entries or update existing ones using data from finalized metadata JSON files (e.g., `_final_for_router.json`).
-   **Caution:** Direct modifications to this file are complex. My scripts aim for safe updates, but this is a critical file for the magazine's operation.

### 5.2. `js/theme-engine-clean.js`
-   **Interaction:** I read this file to understand the structure of `sectionModifiers`. When applying theme suggestions (from `theme_suggestions.json`), I programmatically add new, uniquely named section modifiers to the `this.sectionModifiers` object.
-   **Note:** My current scripts focus on *adding* new modifiers rather than directly altering existing ones to maintain stability.

### 5.3. `STYLE_GUIDANCE.md`
-   **Interaction:** I read this file as a source of truth for:
    *   Keywords and "core concepts" to help generate relevant `category` and `tag` suggestions.
    *   Rules for interpreting `visual_mood` strings from frontmatter to suggest `ThemeEngine` parameters.
-   This guide (which you are reading) is also a product of my drafting capabilities.

### 5.4. EditorialAI System (Payload Files)
-   **Interaction:** I do not directly call `window.EditorialAI.logEditorialAction()`. Instead, after completing significant actions (subtasks), I generate JSON payload files (e.g., `editorial_ai_*.json`) in the repository root.
-   **Purpose:** These files contain structured log data that you (Paul, or an external system) can use to make the actual calls to `window.EditorialAI.logEditorialAction`, effectively logging my actions and their outcomes into the EditorialAI system.

### 5.5. Python Processing Scripts (`*.py` in repository root)
-   **Interaction:** These are the scripts I create and execute to perform the pipeline tasks (e.g., `process_markdown.py`, `suggest_metadata.py`, `finalize_data_and_assets.py`, etc.).
-   **Development:** I draft these scripts based on the objectives of each subtask. They are designed to be modular and focus on specific processing steps.

## 6. Requesting Specific Manual Tasks from Jules

While much of my work is automated based on new content batches, you can also request specific "manual" (i.e., ad-hoc, not tied to a new batch) tasks:

-   **Updating Published Content:** If an already "live" article needs metadata changes or minor content updates, you can provide me with the article ID and the specific changes. I can then help prepare an updated `_final_for_router.json` and potentially update the router.
-   **Visual Changes Not Linked to New Batches:** If you want to, for example, add a new global theme to `themeLibrary` in `theme-engine-clean.js`, or adjust an existing `sectionModifier` directly, you can instruct me to do so.
-   **Asset Management:** If you need to process a standalone asset or update asset links, provide the details.
-   **Documentation Updates:** I can help draft or update documentation like this guide or `STYLE_GUIDANCE.md`.

For such requests, clear instructions on the target file(s), the specific changes, and the expected outcome are most helpful.

## 7. Troubleshooting & Known Issues

This section documents known issues or areas where the automated processing might have limitations.

### 7.1. Audio File Visibility (`ls` Discrepancy)
-   **Issue:** During asset processing (`process_audio_assets.py`) and finalization (`finalize_data_and_assets.py`), Python's file operations (`shutil.copy2`, `os.makedirs`, `os.path.isdir`) report success for creating directories and copying audio files to both `/content_pipeline/processed_assets/audio/` and `/app/assets/audio/`. The scripts update metadata based on this reported success.
-   **Problem:** However, subsequent `ls` commands in the sandbox environment sometimes fail to show these audio directories or the files within them, even though images and documents copied by similar logic in the same scripts *are* visible via `ls`.
-   **Impact:** This means while I believe audio assets are processed and moved, and metadata reflects this, their physical presence as verifiable by `ls` can be inconsistent. This seems to be a sandbox-specific issue related to how file system changes for these paths/operations are reflected to `ls`.
-   **Current Status:** The scripts operate based on Python's feedback. The metadata will reflect what Python believes to be true.

### 7.2. `allArticles` Array Overwrite Incident (Router Update)
-   **Issue:** During the development of `update_router_article.py` (Subtask 23), an early version of the script, due to parsing difficulties with existing JavaScript objects in `js/magazine-router.js`, inadvertently removed all pre-existing articles from the `allArticles` array when attempting to update `sample_article`.
-   **Resolution:** The script was simplified to replace the entire content of `allArticles` with only the single, updated `sample_article`. This was acceptable because `sample_article` was the only article the pipeline had processed and added to the router up to that point (other original articles in the router were hardcoded examples).
-   **Future Implication:** If `js/magazine-router.js` were to contain multiple, complex, manually-added articles, the current `update_router_article.py` script would need significant enhancements to its JavaScript parsing capabilities to safely update one article while preserving others. For now, it assumes it's managing a list of articles that conform to the structure it generates.

### 7.3. Batch Processing Failures
-   **General:** If a script in the pipeline fails, subsequent scripts may not run, or may operate on incomplete/stale data.
-   **Error Reporting:** Each script is designed to output an `errors` list in its JSON summary. The `00_PROCESSING_SUMMARY.md` also tries to collate these.
-   **Debugging:** The JSON output from each script, including any error messages and the `editorial_ai_message`, should be the first place to look if a batch doesn't process as expected.

## 8. Future Enhancements & Aspirations

This section outlines potential future developments for my capabilities and the VIB3CODE content pipeline.

### 8.1. Advanced NLP for Content Analysis
-   **Current:** Metadata suggestions (`suggest_metadata.py`) use basic text statistics (word frequency, sentence position) and keyword matching.
-   **Future:** Integrate more advanced NLP techniques:
    *   Named Entity Recognition (NER) for better tag and category suggestion.
    *   Sentiment analysis to inform `visual_mood` suggestions.
    *   Topic modeling to identify deeper thematic connections for content linking or categorization.
    *   Summarization algorithms for more nuanced excerpt generation.

### 8.2. Deeper Visualizer Integration
-   **Current:** `ThemeEngine` parameters influence visualizers. `visual_mood` can suggest these parameters. Glassmorphism UI interaction is aspirational.
-   **Future:**
    *   Fully develop and integrate the advanced visualizer from the conceptual `/visualizer` directory.
    *   Implement the aspirational link between visualizer outputs (textures, colors) and Glassmorphism UI elements (as described in `STYLE_GUIDANCE.md`).
    *   Allow `visual_mood` (or even specific content elements) to trigger more granular and dynamic changes in visualizer behavior beyond just `sectionModifier` parameters.
    *   Explore user-selectable visualizer styles or intensity levels, aligning with EMA's Digital Sovereignty.

### 8.3. Paul's Ideas Welcome!
This entire system is designed to evolve. Your feedback, Paul, and new ideas for how I can better assist in creating and managing VIB3CODE content are always welcome. Let's continue to refine this AI-human partnership to achieve our goal: "Make EMA irresistible by making it beautiful."

*This guide will be updated as the VIB3CODE pipeline and Jules' capabilities evolve.*
