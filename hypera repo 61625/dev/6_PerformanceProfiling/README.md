# 6. Performance Profiling & Optimizations

**Summary:** Systematically analyze and improve the performance of the visualization kernel.

**Details (from Refactoring Summary V.6):**
*   Conduct rigorous performance testing under various conditions (many active UBO channels, complex `dataSnapshot` objects, high-frequency updates).
*   Optimize GLSL shaders and JavaScript data paths.
*   Investigate instanced rendering or other advanced WebGL2 techniques if applicable for certain geometries.

**Core Principles Alignment:**
*   **Lean Kernel & Efficiency:** Core to maintaining a high-performance system.
*   **Low Latency & High Fidelity:** Directly supports these goals.
*   **Target Use Cases:** Ensures suitability for demanding applications.
