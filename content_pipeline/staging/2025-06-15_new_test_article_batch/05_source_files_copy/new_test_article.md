# My New Test Article

This is a new article created to test the full content pipeline, including asset creation and visual mood processing. It will help ensure that all stages, from asset handling to AI suggestions and final integration, are working correctly.

## Functionality Check

This section aims to verify that features like header images, linked documents, and visual mood settings are picked up and processed by the VIB3CODE pipeline.
